# ARS
AUGMENTED RANDOM SEARCH is a novel approach for Reinforcement Learning which uses the method of finite differences and it is able to do the exact same thing that Google Deep Mind did in their accomplishment last year - which is to train an AI to walk and run across a field.

However, ARS is claimed to be 100x times faster and 100x times more powerful. (anyone can beg to differ here)

Having said that, This is very basic implementation of ARS algorithm, with just around 100 lines of code taking help from one of the courses penned by Hadelin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadelin-de-ponteves-1425ba5b/) , Kiril (https://www.linkedin.com/in/keremenko/) and Jordan.



This implementation Does not uses any Deep learning framework / libraries like Tensorflow, Theano or Keras.

ARS was used to train the Half-Cheetah to run in an environment defined with rewards for a good episode and action.
